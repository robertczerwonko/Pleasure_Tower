# Pleasure_Tower
Game I'm currently working on... <br />
Based on falling mechanic, one tap means slighty to avoid red elements of tower.
The script "Tower_Spawner" in project is responsible for:
-calculating falling elements position on cylinder tower;
-calculating amount of this elements in each row (depends on scale)
-calculating amount of Rows (depends on height)
-spawn those elements with calculated information
